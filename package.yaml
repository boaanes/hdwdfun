# Metadata used when publishing your package
synopsis:            Functional implementation of both a multiway dataflow constraint systems
                     engine in haskell, inspired by HotDrink, as well as an implementation of
                     of my own interpretation of the WarmDrink specification.
category:            CLI

# To avoid duplicated efforts in documentation and dealing with the
# complications of embedding Haddock markup inside cabal files, it is
# common to point users to the README.md file.
